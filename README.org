A solution to configute a local machine setup after reinstallin OS.

** Targets
- Should be as easy as run a curl | bash to install the tool.

- Should provide a convinient way to write configuration:
  - All standard chores like creating a simlink, copy a file should be built-in
  - Usable and easy to use configuration file formats
  - A simple way to have logic embedded. E.g. if currentOs == OS.Darwin do some stuff

  - Installing nodejs
